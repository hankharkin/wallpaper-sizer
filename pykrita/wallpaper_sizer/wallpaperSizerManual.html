    <h1>Wallpaper Sizer</h1>
    <h2>For resizing images to fit well on your desktop wallpaper</h2>
    <p>This plugin solves the problem of desktop wallpaper not quite fitting, being stretched out,
        leaving blank spaces on the edges, etc.  Currently, this is my personal project that I'm making
        because I have 3 monitors, all with different sizes, orientations, and resolutions.  So, finding
        wallpaper that fits right is impossible.<br><br>
        This plugin will first expand or shrink the image to match a given dimension.  Only then will
        it crop the image to the desktop size.  Right now, the desktop sizes are hard-coded because
        it's for me.
